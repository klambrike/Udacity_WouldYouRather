# Would you rather app

The idea of this project is to allow users to ask each other questions, see statistics of answers and show leaderboard of most active users.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Making it work

Inside the project directory, you should first run
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

After that you can run it with

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

This will run the app in the development mode.<br>
Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


######This was developed during the Udacity React course.
